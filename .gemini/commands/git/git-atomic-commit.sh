PROMPT_TEMPLATE="You are an expert at writing Git commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification. Your task is to generate a commit message for the staged changes in the file '__FILE_PATH__'. Analyze the following git diff:
\`\`\`diff
__GIT_DIFF__
\`\`\`
Create a single-line commit message adhering to these strict rules:
1. Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
2. <type>: Choose one: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, build.
3. <scope>: Use the JIRA ID '__JIRA_ID__'.
4. <description>: Write a concise, imperative-mood description of the change.
5. Length: The entire line MUST NOT exceed 72 characters.
Your final output must be ONLY the single-line commit message."
